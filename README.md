## Development
Use chrome for default debug browser for use of its debugging tools!
### Front-end 
Use VS Code, its just easier!  You can add extensions for linters etc.  
(Visual Studio messes up the indentations so not worth it) 

* For coding in React, javascript, css, typescript, etc.
* Front-end directory ./ClientApp

### Back-end
Use Visual Studio to develop the back-end

* For coding in C#, ASP.NET stuff (.cshtml)
